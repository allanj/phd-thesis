Syntactic dependency structures leverage shallow semantic information, which could be helpful for downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP). 
In this thesis, we present some of our recent works on improving named entity recognition (NER) and semantic parsing by making use of the rich structured information in the dependency trees. 
We statistically show the strong correlation between the dependency trees and named entities. 
Specifically, named entities often form subtrees under the dependency tree structures, and the dependency relations (e.g. \textit{nsubj}) are strong indicators for the existence of entities. 
Motivated by the above observations, we proposed the dependency-guided structured models based on the conditional random fields (CRF) to capture the underlying correlations for the NER task. 
Our large-scale experiments on four languages demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, especially for the Catalan and Spanish languages. 
Further analysis reveals that the improvements mainly result from the dependency relations and long-distance interactions provided by dependency trees.

Our following research work attacks a more challenging and semantic-level task, semantic parsing without the given dependency trees. 
The semantic parsing task is to map the natural language sentences into (tree-structured) logical forms. 
We introduce a dependency-based hybrid tree representation to capture the interactions between the semantic units and the natural language words.
However, as the dependency trees are not observed, we regard the dependency trees as the latent structures in our proposed latent-variable model. 
Our dynamic-programming inference procedure is similar to the Eisner's algorithm for dependency parsing. 
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 out of 8 languages, especially for some datasets with flexible word order. 

%The core of these proposed models are based on structured prediction.

First and foremost, I'm very grateful to have Prof. Wei Lu as my PhD advisor. 
Without a doubt, I have a lot of for him.
What I have learned from him during these years will benefit me for the rest of my life.  
He is the person who is sincerely serious about research, which really impresses me.
I first met Prof. Wei Lu in 2014 when I did my internship with him and I knew nothing about NLP. 
%He worked day and night and often went home at around 3 am. 
He is extremely efficient and focused during working. 
He taught me what correct attitude is to research, how to do good research in terms of reading, writing, my presentation skill, and more importantly, how to think independently as a researcher. 
All of the things that he endowed me and I have learned from him can not be simply stated in a few sentences. 
But I really appreciate that I can spend these four years with him. 


I would like to thank my mother and brother for their support during my PhD study. 
They do not give me pressure and support most of the decisions I made, though my mom is sometimes a bit immature and she is the ``funniest'' one in the family.
When I get into trouble like mental problems, I often seek help from my brother.  
Talking to him makes me feel better and he is the one usually talks a lot though what he said is not really helpful. 
I really enjoy the happiness and joy in this family.

Throughout my PhD study, there are a lot of friends who have provided their help to me. 
Aldrian, who was previously a research assistant in our group, gave me tremendous guidance in my first year. 
He is a really smart and also very friendly teacher to me. 
Raymond and Li Hao had a lot of research discussions with me during my PhD study. 
Besides research, we chat with each other on our PhD life. 
I really appreciate the conversations with them as it sometimes helps me get away from the pressure of ``tough'' research.
Gary and I joined the PhD program together back to Jan 2016. 
Yuqi and Gary are my best friends since I join SUTD. 
We took classes together, played together and talk about everything. 
I really appreciate the time that we spent in our PhD study and wish them a promising fortune in the future. 
Of course, there are so many friends and team members that I haven't mentioned but I'm really grateful for their appearance in my life. 
PhD life sometimes is tough. 
Because of them, it makes my life more fun and more wonderful. 

After finishing the defense, I really appreciate Prof. Jiang Jing for her comments on this thesis. 
I have a lot respect to her in the field of natural language processing. 
She read through the thesis and wrote many useful comments especially some of them are really inspiring for my future research direction. 
I would also love to work with Prof. Jiang Jing in the future. 

Last but certainly not least, I would like to thank the one inside my heart (\textit{i.e.}, myself) for insisting on the PhD study. 
Four years ago, you had already gone through 1-year PhD life and I know that was a really tough and stressed time for you.
Thus, you quit that PhD and Prof. Wei Lu gave you a second chance to demonstrate yourself. 
But I know you were still very stressed and somehow you might have lost your faith in doing the PhD. 
You were even thinking that you do not have any talents in doing research. 
Though you published some papers, you also failed so many research topics. 
After several failures, you doubted yourself, questioned yourself and denied yourself that you can do a good job. 
Later on, you realized that it is not about just research and publishing papers. 
You realized that you love doing research, especially good research.
No matter if you can publish in the top conference or not, you still love doing research. 
As your advisor requires, I hope  you are already an independent researcher now. 
I hope you can keep doing great research in the future and do not forget your original motivation for doing a PhD.
